#Foodel - start here!

Some basics:

1) There are two Eclipse Java projects in the repo
-optimiser which contains the optimisation libraries
-server which provides the front end

2) This software is designed to run using a browser based front end. Running the server project creates a web server (using JLHTTP) which listens on a port (8080 by default but this can be set in server.properties). Connect a browser and off you go (http://localhost:8080 should get you started.
