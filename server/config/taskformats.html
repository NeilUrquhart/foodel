<p>
Foodel tasks are formated as csv files, this means that they can be created and edited using most spreadsheet packages. 
The first section of the file defines your task, with attributes such as your depot location, vehicle capacities and
time constraints.

The second part of the CSV file is a list of deliveries to be organised into routes.
<br><br>
Currently Foodel understands 3 types of task: <br><br>
<p></p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Home Deliveries +</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
Most delivery problems will fall into this type. The deliveries will be divided into routes based upon vehicle capacity and
time limits. As many routes as required will be created to ensure that all of the deliveries  are dealt with efficiently.

</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Deliveries using volunteers +</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
This task type is designed for organisations that use volunteers to make deliveries. Each volunteer has a delivery route allocated to them, the routes will be designed
to try to ensure that each route finishes reasonably close to the volunteers' home.

This task type is designed for organisations that have a fixed number of vehicles and cannot have more than a set number of routes.
